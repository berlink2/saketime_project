The original location of the brewery was in Ogawa Village, on the opposite bank of the Tama River. In 1881, Ishikawa Brewery built a new kura (storehouse) in the present Kumagawa area and, in 1883, the whole business finished moving to this location. Ishikawa Brewery earlier used 'Yae-zakura' (double-flowered cherry) as a brand name at first after the establishment of the business. This brand name showed the sister-company relationship with Morita Shuzo in Ogawa Village, who brewed 'Yae-giku' (double-flowered chrysanthemum). In 1919, the brand was renamed 'Yae-ume', (double-flowered plum), and in 1933, the present brand name, 'Tamajiman', came to be used.", "slug": "ishikawa-brewery", "image": "image/upload/v1588670014/sake_time/breweries/p81mlb9vhbjnykramkev.png", "lat": 35.72021, "long": 139.332554, "website": "https://www.tamajiman.co.jp/en/", "header": "image/upload/v1588670016/sake_time/breweries/gidqenoarwji5gnutzex.jpg"}}]
